We would like you to build a playable version of connect four. You can assume for now that it will require two players, though we may want to add a single-player mode in the future. You can develop the game in any language, using any framework, and there must be some form of a UI to view the current board/game progress (CLI is fine).

### Criteria

- Minimum is a working 2-player game
- 6 row x 7 column
- If the turn is invalid, player must play again
- All termination conditions complete (4 in a row/column/diagonal)
- Well-structured code for extensibility
- The game can be played in CLI or a browser.
- Printing of the table is a must; print statements are ok.
